# Rundown Anarchy

- Hey there! Anarchy is a vanilla rundown featuring various dimensions, demanding excellent teamwork and gaming skills. True to its name, you'll need to combat anarchy and disadvantages. I've crafted unique and challenging levels based on my experiences with Rundowns 6 and 7. It has been adjusted to a difficulty higher than R8.

- For the complete Anarchy experience, I suggest playing without the use of any boosters, glitchs, cheats or other mods.

- All levels are possible to clear. My team has cleared them without boosters. There are no secret strategies known only to the developers, so please do your best.

Thank you for playing! Enjoy the fight!  

Special thanks to my team(Scotch, Jonino, Cross) and friends.
